    title: "RactiveJS: Make Your Life as a Webapp Developer Simpler"
    description: >
      Many tools exist to help you build web apps, but very few deal with the fundamental problem:
      HTML, while excellent at describing static documents, wasn't designed for interactivity.
      Ractive changes that.


      RactiveJs is very simple to get started and it's powerful enough to help you get things done
      perfectly without the hassle and learning curve.


      It also has great performance.

    title: Exploring the Option of Having One Source Repo to Rule Them All
    description: >
      Both Google and Facebook keep all their source code in one single repository, is there
      something there to learn from them?


      This talk will go over advantages and disadvantages to putting all your code into one
      repository. There's also some interesting aspects to how your CI/CD pipeline starts looking
      when you're taking everything from the same repository.


      Likely talking points will be:
      <ul>
      <li>Git vs Mercurial</li>
      <li>CI/CD servers and how they'll work with this (Concourse, GoCD, and some cloud solution
      like CircleCI or SnapCI)</li>
      </ul>

    title: The Magic Behind Engineers.SG
    description: >
      As the creator of <a href="https://engineers.sg" target="_blank">Engineer.SG</a>, I spent 1
      year fine-tuning the techniques used in capturing and videographing conference and meetup
      talks. The system has now been replicated and taught to more than 40 volunteers.


      I will now share how it is done with the GeekCamp.SG audience.

    title: Category Theory for Mortals
    description: >
      Category theory is an esoteric branch of math which has found a use in Functional Programming
      (Haskell, Scala etc.). I will explain what Category Theory is, why it is useful and show you
      how you can use in your own work.


      If you don't know how to make a Monad by the end of my talk, I will have failed.
