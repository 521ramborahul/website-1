    title: 'WebAudio: an Emerging Platform for Modern Audio Applications'
    description: >
      The Web Audio standard is enabling the creation of fully functional Audio
      application made with open Web technologies. This talk will go through
      the basics of the functionality that Web Audio enables, and highlight
      some open source libraries, frameworks and projects built on top of Web
      Audio.

      If you have attended JSConf Asia last year you probably liked the 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BIOINFSbMg">Live Audiovisual
      Performances talk by Charlie Roberts</a>.
      <br><br>
      And you might also have come across the
      <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/01nov_ismsounds/">
      sounds of interstellar space</a> that NASA shared couple of years ago.
      <br><br>
      We have two great masterpieces to get started with. In my talk I will
      briefly discuss about both and then jump into Swift (Apple's new
      programming language) and SceneKit to create music visualization of the
      interstellar sounds.

      An outline of the ever-hot debate surrounding various patterns of async
      programming and how/when to use them: Callbacks vs Promises vs Event
      Emitters vs Streams vs Generators vs Co-Routines vs ???

  talk:
    title: 'Signal-ing Out of Callback Hell'
    description: >
      Async processes are hard to reason about. Especially when you're
      debugging them under four layers of nested callbacks.  From handling
      complex UI interactions to coordinating parallel tasks, programming in an
      async world can be frustrating, especially if you're using an imperative
      programming languange/framework with mutable state. 
      <br><br>
      This talk will examine how Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) provides
      a solution to these problems. By modelling async flows as streams of
      values, and performing transformations on those streams, FRP enables such
      processes to be written in a safer, declarative manner. This talk would
      use <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa
      </a> and how it aids development on iOS and Mac as a case study.

      Sony released a <a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/lens-style-camera">
      smartphone attachable camera</a> in 2013, which is attachable
      to your smartphone. And they also opened the Camera Remote API to
      developers. I'd like to introduce the
      <a href="https://github.com/akirahrkw/QXCameraKit"> API library which I
      made</a> to connect to the camera and to control it.

      At an AI Stanford summer camp, I used Machine Learning to build a self

      I designed and tested these algorithms, and discuss how they performed.

    title: 'JavaScript Obfuscation'
    description: >
      JavaScript Obfuscation demystified. Everyone writing JavaScript knows
      that there are multiple ways of doing the same thing. Developers build
      filters to catch malicious JavaScript, but a wily attacker can obfuscate
      JavaScript so that filters can be bypassed.
      <br><br>
      This session will teach participants multiple JavaScript implementation
      details and how these are used to build obfuscated code. We will also
      discuss how to dissect already obfuscated code. The session is divided
      into two parts: first part will expose participants to different
      components of JavaScript internals and how they can be used to create
      obfuscated code. The second part will help them to decipher obfuscated
      code.
