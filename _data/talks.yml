    description: >
      Many tools exist to help you build web apps, but very few deal with the fundamental problem: HTML, while excellent at describing static documents, wasn't designed for interactivity. Ractive changes that. 


      RactiveJs is very simple to get started and it's powerful enough to help you get things done perfectly without the hassle and learning curve.


      It also has great performance.

    title: Exploring the Option of Having One Source Repo to Rule Them All
    description: >
      Both Google and Facebook keep all their source code in one single repository, is there something there to learn from them?


      This talk will go over advantages and disadvantages to putting all your code into one repository. There's also some interesting aspects to how your CI/CD pipeline starts looking when you're taking everything from the same repository.


      Likely talking points will be:
      <ul>
      <li>Git vs Mercurial</li>
      <li>CI/CD servers and how they'll work with this (Concourse, GoCD, and some cloud solution like CircleCI or SnapCI)</li>
      </ul>
